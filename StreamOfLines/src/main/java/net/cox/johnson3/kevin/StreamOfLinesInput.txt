Introduction to Programming Using Java is a free introductory computer programming
textbook that uses Java as the language of instruction. It is suitable for use in an introductory
programming course and for people who are trying to learn programming on their own. There
are no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the ideas of computers and programs.
There is more than enough material for a full year of college-level programming. Chapters 1
through 7 can be used as a textbook in a one-semester college-level course or in a year-long
high school course. The remaining chapters can be covered in a second course.
The Eighth Edition of the book uses Java 8, with brief coverage of features that were added
to the language in Java 9 and later. JavaFX is used for GUI programming. All sample programs
and exercise solutions have been compiled with Java 11 and with Java 14, as well as with Java 8.
